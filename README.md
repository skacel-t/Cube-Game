# Cube-Game
 2x2 Cube Trainer and Simulator

 Welcome to the 2x2 Cube Trainer. Currently, this program built using PyGame has two functionalities. First, we display a virtual cube and allow the user to scramble and solve it using keyboard controls. Second, the user can use this app to practice CLL. By clicking the CLL Case button, the user gets a CLL case to solve. We provide the ability to choose which CLL subsets one wishes to practice. Simply de-select the checkboxes corresponding to the subsets you do not wish to practice. 

 The cube and any art in the program (including checkboxes) is hand-drawn. 

 HOW TO RUN THE APP:
 	1. Install Python onto your system.
 	2. Download the project files.
 	3. Create and activate a virtual environment in the project folder and install required modules from requirements.txt. 
 		a. You can also install the requirements directly onto your mashine, rather than using a virtual environment. This is generally not recommended.
 	4. Run the game with 'python3 app.py'.
